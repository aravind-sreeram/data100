## Reflection 2

*Kitchin emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomena. How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study?  How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, behavior and relationships? How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?*

The article stresses the importance of measurement, and more specifically, how big data’s massive scales of measurement give us amazingly large quantities of evidence and numerical data points to analyze and uncover answers to questions we haven’t even asked yet. The advent of big data greatly serves this revolution in measurement through multiple ways, the first of which involves massive collection of datasets, both qualitative and quantitative, about almost everything.
   
The advent of big data has allowed us to constantly collect new information and measurements that pertain to almost every field imaginable. In healthcare, we can track statistics of public health and safety and design models to depict how those numbers vary from county to county and even state to state. In business, we can track the revenues and other numerical indicators of a company’s performance and with enough data points over a span of 5-10 years, we can predict the characteristics of good companies and bad ones. Essentially, with enough knowledge about the past and the present, big data allows us to make fruitful and accurate decisions and claims about the future on which we can immediately act. On the qualitative side, satellites and image processing systems are collecting millions of images that can later be interpreted via a neural network and provide us qualitative insights on how to improve housing areas, which areas of poverty to target with outreach, etc. This revolution in measurement presents a problem that is scarcely seen in any other field, and that is the abundance of data. Kitchin notes that while other fields are usually trying to make sense of a portion of data that may have been painstakingly, manually collected, big data ponders and has to act on data in volumes that no one has ever seen in the past. It takes the notion of “data collection” to the next level and removes that limitation from existence when analyzing such large-scale events, prompting us to take advantage of the mounds of information given to us.
   
In turn, this makes the field of data science almost transcend the boundaries of separation between other STEM and even humanities fields. It allows data science to be interpreted as a tool rather than an end-all solution to use. If we wanted to analyze the occurrence and shift in dialect across old movies to new ones to provide historical accuracy for a new plat, data science can analyze scripts and a model can be created to make sense of the millions of words it would be reading. It could produce a dialect dictionary that would be historically accurate to a certain time period based on the shift of language. Big data collected on the change of the global atmosphere could be used in geology and meteorology to not only tie in the climate’s impact on the changing Earth but also tectonic plates and other underground forces acting upon its shape. Since measurement is such an innate part of human nature, and big data allows us to advance technology to collect measurements on almost anything, it is ignorant to even suggest that any sort of coding language or field of study is a limitation to the application of big data’s usage.
   
In terms of the lasting change that big data and its analysis will leave on humans and our understanding of a dynamic human development, I think it’s safe to say that the occurrence of this abundance of data will never leave our world facing the same problems it did just a short while ago. Although big data will definitely change the world of STEM, that relies on extensive empirical investigations and measurements, it will also leave its mark on the humanities by serving as a pivotal tool with which to uncover pieces of information that may have never been available through conventional studies. Although small-scale studies still have their benefits and present their own set of problems, big data introduces us to endless amounts of information and challenges us to create a model to make sense of them all.
   
By understanding how common sets of big data can affect us, our society, and our world, it becomes imperative to break the boundaries we have between fields of study and develop interdisciplinary methods to combine our knowledge and make sense of the enormous collection of information presented to us.
