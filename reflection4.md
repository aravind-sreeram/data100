## Reflection 4

*Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Provide an example.*

West’s piece explains that scale is a peculiar yet observably intriguing thing, and can be used to better understand many aspects of our world. From academia to medicine to even outer space, knowledge of scaling is a useful tool to predict and anticipate the changes that await our world.

West talks about urbanization and population growth early on, saying that countries are quickly changing and some, like China, are planning to build numerous cities and grow their urbanization over as little as 25-30 years. This rapid urbanization can be thought of as scaling, and there are simple models we can use to anticipate this data. The model used to represent our rapid urbanization is exponential, and West says that in a few decades, we will be seeing over 1.5 million individuals get urbanized each week. This is in addition to the ~3.7 billion people who are already urbanized in today’s world. Although I’m not sure West takes into account carrying capacity as a variable in his primarily exponential growth model, this is still an astonishing number to behold and the use of governmental declarations like that of China’s to support it affirms that this is more than just a potentially inaccurate extrapolation. It is also worthwhile to note West’s claim about how cities must develop organically rather than artificially constructed through buildings and architecture. China is attempting to create new cities not out of organic necessity, but to artificially migrate individuals into them, which West sees as a somewhat futile attempt. 

West also talks about the concept of sublinear scaling, or that phenomena where size does not proportionally correlate to resources as one may think. He gives the example of gas stations in an increasingly developing city. As a city doubles in size, one may think that it will require twice as many gas stations, to keep the gas stations per capita value constant. What is observed is actually a reduced number of gas stations, meaning that each station must serve more people and have more gas as a result of this development. This also demonstrates the concept of economies of scale, where the independent variables increases at a constant rate, the dependent variable, or number of gas stations per capita here, does not increase at the same pace. Rather, it begins to decrease and eventually level off to achieve a rate of constant returns. This economic principle is usually not applied to such macro-level operations as entire cities, so we do not see the effect of constant returns or even diseconomies of scale.

West also mentions power law distributions as opposed to typical Gaussian distributions, or what many people call a Bell Curve. He talks about how we generally assume a bell curve to apply for most things without considering the possibility of a power law model. For many scenarios, like the number of cities or the frequency of words, “rare occurrences” are much more common than would be expected if we followed a Gaussian trend. This leads to something we call having a “fat tail” and West explains how these models usually do not get used when examining trends in which they may very well be applicable. This different way of thinking can be used to far better understand how cities, countries, and even completely different fields of thought like those in linguistics and academies can be predicted at scale.

West introduces big data as something that people automatically assume will lead us to having a better, deeper understanding of the universe. People simply assume that more data is better, even if we have no sense of it or have no idea where to begin with its analysis. This is analogous to the saying we’ve all heard of yet still like to forget: “correlation doesn’t equal causation.”

The importance of having a theory to support your analysis of the data is emphasized, because without a suitable theory, analysis can be easily misguided or even a completely futile attempt. West explains how some corporations and institutions are ditching the conventional scientific methodology and thinking in pursuit of big data analysis, saying that we can find answers to questions we never knew we had. West takes a bit more orthodox approach and says that a theory is still pivotal to our understanding of big data, and without a theory to support our research, we wouldn’t have gotten as far as we are today. He gives the example of the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, and how it led to the discovery of the Higgs mechanism. West explains that through complex algorithms that programmed the LHC to specifically look for certain data points of interest, it was able to discover the mechanism; otherwise, the LHC would be detecting 150 exabytes of information per day, the vast majority of which would be completely useless. West emphasizes that a well-supported theory was solidified far before the LHC was put into effect. By backing up their research with this theory, they were able to collect far more meaningful data and make sense of it much quicker and easier.

In conclusion, this piece says that a theory cannot be simply abandoned in the presence of big data. This mass collection of data should simply augment the traditional scientific method to help researchers more effectively analyze their theories, but theories are pivotal in that they guide us and can help us know what we’re looking for when trying to understand an impossibly complex world.
