Welcome! My name is Aravind, I'm a freshman at William & Mary taking DATA 100, or Wicked Problems. I am originally from Jacksonville, FL, but I moved to Northern Virginia in middle school and have lived there since. I attended TJHSST for high school and at W&M, I am majoring in Neuroscience with a minor in Marketing. In my free time, I like to go on runs, play the piano, and play games like Clue or Chess with my family.
