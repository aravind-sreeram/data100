## Reflection 5

*Using  these  ideas  from  Aral,  Georgescu-Roegen,  and  Geoff  West  as  well  as  other sources  from  this  semester  (including  your  own  personal  insights  and  reflections), how is the advent of data science serving to advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic and social systems?*

Data science is changing the way we measure and think about human and societal behavior. The wicked problems our society face today are in large part being solved by the advent of data analytics, data science, and big data. It is clear that with more information and more measurements, one only needs to learn how to process these values into something meaningful to get a jumpstart on solving many of the tough problems in our world.

I’d like to address the bulk of this question by splitting it up into the three types of systems posited to be advanced in recent years. Although these systems are far from mutually exclusive, it serves as a good guiding point to examine and cross-reference different advances in data science. Firstly, I’ll tackle the advancements made to fix ourselves into an adaptive world; one that is always changing, with new and unanticipated conditions year after year. How are we supposed to prepare and get data for things that we cannot predict or know about? Next I’ll talk about the economic systems that are being benefited through evolving data science. How is the layman and the everyday person gaining any monetary benefit from the advent of data science? Finally, I’ll discuss the social systems that are being revolutionized.

An adaptive system is one that is constantly changing and evolving, almost to the point where we cannot predict what will come next. Over time, our planet has grown to become an even more rapidly adapting system that it was before, simply due to the number of opportunities for change and growth presented to the everyday person. If someone wants to develop an app, there are thousands of platforms through which you can learn to do so and dozens of platforms to create the app itself. If someone wants to get involved in research that may change the way we see medicine today, there are thousands of research institutions that one can join and make contributions to in order to further the cause.

How does data science play a role here? I think a large part of what data science brings to the table has to do with the advent of specifically big data, or essentially, volumes of data so large that we don’t know what to do with all of them. With a little bit of precision and artificial intelligence, we can train machines to do a lot of the hard work for us and reach solutions millions of times faster than humans could. Machines can parse through and analyze data sets from experiments or even nature and provide theories based on their observations, which humans can then either validate or deny. The tool of big data serves as a great accompaniment to the scientific method and allows us to collect massive amounts of data on any new change that comes about. It allows us to even fuel the dynamicity we observe in our world today, and gives a lightning-fast response with huge amounts of data in a short period of time.

Economic systems have to do more with people than nature, as do social systems. I will group these together as they both are interconnected and the contribution that data science makes to both is very similar in its execution. These systems have to do with the everyday person whose life is being made more convenient through data science, even if he/she doesn’t know it.

What is being changed about life now vs. 15 years ago that makes it so much better economically and socially, and how is data science behind all this? Firstly, we revisit Geoff West’s praise of measurement, which has allowed data scientists to create the massive impact we see today in our planet. Measurement is everything, and this can even play into big data as well, because the more data points we acquire, the more chance we may have to make sense of that data and understand a trend. We are rarely in the position (in data science) of having too little data to work with, a barrier that is rarely able to be efficiently broken through otherwise. Yet, with big data, we are able to gather measurements on almost anything we want, whether it be natural or synthetic.

What do we do with all this data? We can then go on to develop new theories that can be put to the test with this data, or even better, we can refine already existing theories that may have not been built when we had this much abundance. This can easily tie into the economy and society when studying trends like gas prices, population sizes in cities, highway traffic, the list goes on and on. There is possibly no limit to what types of data we can analyze and improve the human society with when it comes to the amount of points data science is able to give us.

Although data science is able to present us with a lot of opportunities for startling scientific growth and innovation, there are numerous responsibilities and obligations that come associated with it. Firstly, the amount of big data that is available to be open-sourced and free to the public needs to be limited; I think government control at this level has to be necessary to prevent anyone from accessing harmful data about populations and societies and potentially using it maliciously. Although it may be deemed unfair to subject the population to this exclusion, it is a necessary part of society to keep people safe and under control and it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that risks are minimized while results are maximized to whatever extent possible. While data science is not so government-centered right now, I foresee that with the advent of technology that can be used for international warfare or simply anything destructive (which will soon become inevitable), it will be necessary to impose restrictions on tools and datasets to be available for public use.

Given the proper restrictions, I think data science is poised to become one of the most revolutionary and important fields in STEM over the next decade. The sheer abundance of data opens up one of the most troubling barriers that scientists have faced for centuries, and our rapidly growing technology simply makes the sky not even close to the limit of what can be done in the way of societal and academic advancement.
